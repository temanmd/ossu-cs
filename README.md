# About

My progress in studying at [Open Source Society University](https://github.com/ossu/computer-science) in the Computer Science department.

# Summary

The OSSU curriculum is a **complete education in computer science** using online materials.
It's not merely for career training or professional development.
It's for those who want a proper, *well-rounded* grounding in concepts fundamental to all computing disciplines.
